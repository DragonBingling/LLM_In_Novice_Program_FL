Given a code snippet.
There are x lines in total.
Index each line of source code(An empty line also counts a line).
most of them are right.But there exist fault.
There are no compilation errors.
when input data to program,what makes the output result is not as expected is the fault.
You should analyze the code and give each line an estimate of how likely an error is to occur.
the sum of them is 100%,and they cannot be equal to each other.
Sort and output them from most likely to least likely.
Just output the result and nothing else.
each line output format is as follows,replace a,b to your answer:
line a possibility: b%,[code of this line]
