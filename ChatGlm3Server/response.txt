Based on the given code snippet, here are my estimates of how likely each line is to be faulty, sorted from most likely to least likely:

1. line 9:的可能性为 20%
2. line 12:的可能性为 10%
3. line 22:可能性为 5%
4. line 26:可能性为 2%
5. line 29:可能性为 1%
6. line 31:可能性为 1%
7. line 35:可能性为 1%
8. line 38:可能性为 1%
9. line 41:可能性为 1%
10. line 44:可能性为 1%
11. line 49:可能性为 10%
12. line 52:可能性为 5%
13. line 56:可能性为 2%
14. line 60:可能性为 1%

Please note that these probabilities are based on my understanding of the code and do not guarantee that the actual error rate will be the same.
